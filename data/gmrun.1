.SH DESCRIPTION
.\" TeX users may be more comfortable with the \fB<whatever>\fP and
.\" \fI<whatever>\fP escape sequences to invode bold face and italics, 
.\" respectively.
\fBgmrun\fP is a GTK program that allows a user to use a CLI-like interface to launch applications.
.SH OPTIONS
If gmrun is invoked with a command-line parameter, that will be the initial content of the dialog box.
.PP
gmrun can be customized using a configuration file, ~/.gmrunrc . The system-wide configuration file is /etc/gmrunrc .
.PP
The format of the configuration file is simple; "variable = value".

.TP
.B History
Number of entered commands which should be kept in gmrun's history(~/.gmrun_history). Using the Up and Down arrow keys within the gmrun window will cycle through the history. You can search backwards through the history with Ctrl+R, and forward with Ctrl+S. Hit "!" to enter a special search that matches only the start of strings. To cancel a search, hit the \fIESC\fP key. Otherwise, after you have found the history item you wish to run, hit Enter. Also: CTRL-P = Up / CTRL-N = Down.
.TP
.B ShowLast
Whether to show the last command as initial text, or an empty textarea (1 or 0).
.TP
.B Selected
Whether the initial text should be selected or not (1 or 0).
.SH URL/File HANDLING
.TP
.B USE_GLIB_XDG = 1
For automatic URL and File handling using the freedesktop specification.
.TP
See /etc/gmrunrc for custom URL and extension handlers (USE_GLIB_XDG = 0)
.TP
The included configuration files have a few examples which you can work with. You should also note that the protocol part of URL_protocol can be *anything*. You can set up "URL_foobarbazcustom", and so long as you enter in "foobarbazcustom:<whatever>", it will use the given program.
