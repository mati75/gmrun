gmrun (0.7.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
  * Added Build-depend on g++-3.0; I simply don't know enough C++ to cope

  * Modifications to upstream source:
    + Undid all previous modifications if said modifications dealt with
      gcc/gcc-3.0 incompatibilities.
    + Removed the added ampersand in main.cc(line 92), and instead call
      fork() in main.cc(lines 176 and 177). This actually works! :)

gmrun (0.6.1-2) unstable; urgency=low

gmrun (0.6.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Initial Release (closes: Bug#108057)

     + Replaced call to std::char_traits with std::string_char_traits(same
       reason as above modifications)
     + src/prefs.cc: look in /etc/ for the global gmrunrc, as opposed
       to /usr/share/gmrun/
     + config/Makefile.in: change "myrcdir" such that the global gmrunrc
       will be installed to /etc/gmrunrc
