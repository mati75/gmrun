      gcc/gcc-3.0 incompatibilities.
    + Removed the added ampersand in main.cc(line 92), and instead call
      fork() in main.cc(lines 176 and 177). This actually works! :)

       reason as above modifications)

       to /usr/share/gmrun/
     + config/Makefile.in: change "myrcdir" such that the global gmrunrc
       will be installed to /etc/gmrunrc
