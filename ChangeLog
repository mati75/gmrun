==========
gmrun 1.0w
==========

Highlights:
   - GTK 3 support (default - use --enable-gtk2 to compile the gtk2 port)
   - should work with GTK 2.12+ (or even older GTK versions)
   - fixed broken CTRL-R / CTRL-S
   - gmrun is now a C application
   - added desktop file and icon
   - added manual
   - changed license to ISC (approved by @mishoo)
   - support Glib XDG handling (set USE_XDG = 1 in gmrunrc)
   - keep support for custom extension and url handlers
     (the app is a bit more complex than it should because of this)
   - restore --geometry param (it's a bit different)
   - gmrunrc: Geometry = (read comments)

mishoo (73):
      Initial revision
      These files are generated.
      little bug fixed in gtkcompletionline.cc (the prev. version works with an older compiler)
      Removed useless files
      jump to new version
      removed unconditional debug output.
      added drop-down list (nice)
      switch to new version (added drop-down list functionality)
      *** empty log message ***
      some nice changes - fixed bug, completion window is displayed even if we're not completing the last word.  Also, cursor now marks two words for completion, even if there's no space between.
      some bugs fixes, support for CTRL-ENTER starts command in terminal.
      new version
      Added support for configuration file
      fix compilation prob.
      configure -- switch to new version gtkcompletionline -- much smoother completion.. select completed-text..                      etc, really better.. prefs -- added support for $(Variable) expansion main -- added 3 config options: Top, Left (opper-left corner)
      End, Escape -- clear the selection
      -- swithced to new version -- more intuitive tab completion (hit tab only once, and the list is shown) -- fixed bug in prefs (made it recursive, so can replace more than one variable on a line) -- ... and other nice things :) hopefully
      fixed bug in gtkcompletionline.cc -- crashed when no completion found..
      case-insensitive std::string-like class
      *** empty log message ***
      default configuration file
      added support for default configuration file
      switched to new version
      revert to normal version (0.5.3-2 not good for building rpms..)
      [main.cc] set widget names [history.cc] history size moved to config file (not hard coded) [gmrunrc] set history size in default config file
      changed gdk_window_set_position to gtk_widget_set_uposition -- got rid of flicker.. :)
      updated
      *** empty log message ***
      trying to add CTRL-R feature from bash...
      updated code to support backward / forward searching through history using CTRL-R / CTRL-S as in bash / Emacs.
      fixed bug in CTRL-R/S searching. added code for backspace in history search mode.
      switched to new version (0.5.4)
      search phrase gets nice selected :)
      various bug fixes
      bug fixing / improvement..
      *** empty log message ***
      rpm spec file
      hmm...
      added "!" to complete from history with the last command beginning with the entered text
      cosmetic...
      updated
      new version
      - bug fixes - nice window, no titlebar
      fixed bug
      added URL-handling ability (check the config file)
      modified for URL-s also, added some small comments to make content clearer for user.
      changed version
      README -- improved documentation. configure -- hmm... this should be removed from CVS, but... later.
      removed.  moved to gmrun.spec.in -- to be generated by configure.
      generates gmrun.spec when configure is run
      support for creating gmrun.spec
      fixed bug
      programs are now executed with exec*p
      fixed bug
      another bug fix... :)
      changes related to generation of gmrun.spec
      fixed some bugs; new features:
      updated for new configuration parameters
      updated for the new release
      fixed bug
      fixed bugs, new configuration parameter: ShowLast (1 / 0) to determine if gmrun should display the last history item as selected by default. (maybe some users don't like that...)
      added nice frame around the completion window
      *** empty log message ***
      included some patches from Michal Politowski (thanks!);
      bug fixes:   - file names containing white-space now (hopefully) behave correctly   - others, I don't remember
      they're kind of old, but..
      these are automatically generated, duh..
      preparing for a new version
      finally, I write news :)
      new bugfix version
      bugfixes: END/HOME (C-E/C-A) behavior is now much better, some code cleanup (mainly reindentation :)), removed some warnings, etc.  Major bug fixed is that previously (with 0.8) you could not edit a .doc file with soffice if you had .doc extension handler set as AbiWord :)
      0.8.1 news
      bug fixed (the "e"/"E" character doesn't clear selection)

sonofkojak (1):
      Added support for STLPort.
