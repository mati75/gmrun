* Terminal spawning:
  - just activate your command by pressing not only ENTER but CTRL-ENTER
  (i.e.: man perl<CTRL-ENTER>)

  - hit TAB key to get a list of possible completions
    (isn't that obvious, duh!?! =]~ ) 

* Window too large?
  - read README.gmrunrc

* Want to run eterm/kterm/rxvt/gnome-terminal/footerm instead xterm?
  - read README.gmrunrc
